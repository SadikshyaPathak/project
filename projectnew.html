   <p class="paragraph">
     Bubble tea has been popular since its introduction in the 1980s throughout Asia and is now becoming increasingly trendy in America and Europe as well. Now is the perfect time to introduce these delicious beverages to the Austrian foodies!

  <br> <br> Boba aims to give its customers the ultimate bubble tea experience with every sip they take! Here you can try the tasty classics as well as novel seasonal creations and enjoy the new Asian tea culture with the people you love! Our mission is to break the old-fashioned prejudice that tea is just a hot drink you have during cold days but a lifestyle and lovely experience! We wish to make tea an indispensable part of your day.
     
      <br><br>Our secret to success is simple: Carefully-selected tea leaves, homemade syrups, fresh fruits, a mind for creativity and constantly working to further improve our products. We put the utmost care into our drinks and you will taste the quality!
